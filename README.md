Weather Sprint
Created a weather app according to a Figma designed by another student. Used OpenWeatherMap API to pull down weather data. Implemented search and geolocation functionality, in addition to a favorites list.

Peer review comments: everything works very well the only thing is when i looked at the figma your fonts are off but saving and unsaving their are no issues from tests i ran  its almost 1 to 1 with figma  i know if you had more time you would be able to fix these little errors. looking at the js html and css files they are all neatly placed and i could definiley tell you put effort into being organized!
